## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:

4. **Image Loading**: Some image URLs might not load - this is normal for demo purposes

## Next Steps

After running the script:
1. Visit your categories page to see the new products
2. Test the filtering and sorting functionality
3. Check the featured products on your homepage
4. Verify the product detail pages work correctly
